\noindent Listed above is the class I created for my main method. This is where the reading and parsing of both the graph and spice files are done. For the graph file, I split the line by spaces in order to get each indivdual word, where I then looped through to check the contents of each line. When reading through the edge lines, the number of edges got incremented for the weights of each edge, so in the end the number of edges had to be divided by three to get rid of the edges. As for reading and parsing the spice file, I created an original knapsack where the contents of the file were added to. Then using that information, the solveHeist is called for each solution knapsack that was created that held the spices that were taken for the heist. In the main method I added a hard coded example showing that the bellman ford function works, but for some reason there is a problem when sending the graphs created from the file.

            int src = graph.edgeArray[j].source;
            int dest = graph.edgeArray[j].destination;
            int weight = graph.edgeArray[j].weight;

            if (distance[src] != Integer.MAX_VALUE && distance[dest] > distance[src] + weight) {
                System.out.println("There is a negative weight cycle in the graph.");
                return;
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < verticies; i++) {
            System.out.println("| 0 ---> " + i + " Cost is " + distance[i]);

\noindent This is my DirectedGraph class which contains my bellman ford function. The bellman ford function first initializes each element of the distance array to max value, which is to be changed when finding a shorter path. Next the distance[source] is set to 0 because the source's distance to itself is 0. Then, each edge of the graph has to be relaxed which uses a nested for loop, looping through the verticies and edges of the graph. If there is a shorter path from the source to the destination by calculating the weights, then distance[dest] is updated, so the shortest path gets shorter and shorter. After the nested loop, the edges are iterated through one more time in order to check for negative cycles in the graph because that means the single shortest path can't be calculated. The asymptotic running time for the bellman ford algorithm is O(V * E) where V is the number of verticies in the graph and E is the number of edges in the graph. This is so because of the inner nested for loop that is used to relax the edges in the graph. The outer loop loops until all of the verticies are traversed, and the inner loop runs until the edges are traversed for each vertex. 


\section{Edge Class}

\begin{lstlisting} [language = Java, caption = Edge Class]

public class Edge {

    int source;
    int destination;
    int weight;

        destination = 0;
        weight = 0;
    }

\section{} The DirectedGraph class uses the Edge class, as each graph has an array of edges.

\noindent Lastly, above is my Knapsack class which contains the function solveHeist, which is the function that is responsible for taking the most valuable spices and stealing them, adding to a knapsack. The function uses a while loop that terminates when either the capacity of the knapsack has been reached, or there are no more spices left to take. The sort function uses the java collections in order to sort the arraylist of knapsack items using a comparator and comparing by unitPrice of the spices. The sort method sorts in increasing unitPrice, but we want unitPrice to start at the highest value and be decreasing in order to add the most valuable spices to the knapsack first. The function utilizes the existsInSolution function which just checks if a scoop of spice has already been added to the knapsack. In that case, the quantity of the spice has to be updated, which is the use of tempQuantity2. After each iteration of a spice being added to the knapsack, the quantity of the spice is decremented as well as the knapsack capacity. The asymptotic running time for fractional knapsack is O(nlogn). This is so because the array list has to be sorted, so the while loop takes O(n) time and the sorting takes O(logn).
