The asymptotic running times for both selection sort and insertion sort is $O(n^2)$. Both of these functions iterate through nested for loops which cause the Big Oh upper bound to be $n^2$. On the other hand, merge sort and quick sort have asymptotic running times of O(n*log(n)). Instead of using for loops, these algorithms use recursion and break up the sorting into two steps: divide and conquer. The running time for dividing the array is log(n), and the running time for conquering the array until its sorted is n which makes up the n*log(n). Also, the shuffle method is taking in a completely sorted array and it is randomly moving the elements around, so the number of comparisons is slightly less than expected.
