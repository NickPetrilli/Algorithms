\noindent Listed in the table above is an average of 10 runs for each population size. For a disease with an infection rate of 2 percent these are values that we expect when running the simulation. The slight difference in results when running the simulation for larger population sizes is a result of the distribution method used in this simulation. This simulation models binomial distribution, or selection without replacement which results in the same probability for each trial. When randomly choosing which people in the population get infected, it would be better to remove the infected people to eliminate the possibility of them being infected again. This is the subtle difference between binomial distribution and hypergeometric distribution. Hypergeometric distrubution uses selection with replacement, so when one person gets infected they are already accounted for and the probability slightly increases for the others in the population to be infected. In other words, in binomial distribution the events are indepedent of eachother, whereas in hypergeometric distribution the probability is dependent on the previous draw. This difference in distributions would make the simulation more like real life, which is the overall goal. Another way to improve the simulation would be to account for the fact that the tests aren't perfect and may result in false positives, or even worse false negatives. Also instead of hardcoding the infection rate and group size, letting the user input both of those values will give this simulation more use for different diseases.
